## PUBLIC WRITING AND ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP

This week, I am inspired by Annemarie Perez’s piece, *UndocuDreamers: Public Writing and the Digital Turn*. In this essay, she discusses her thoughts, fears, and responsibilities as a professor of Chicanx studies, and particularly the risks some of her students faced while writing publically online as undocumented immigrants. Perez writes about her struggle to reconcile the use of online public writing as a tool for advocacy with the risks associated with revealing one’s status of citizenship. Perez talks about the idea of public writing as an expression of active citizenship, but she notes that in the absence of citizenship, public writing is taken as an “incitement against the nation state, with some citizens viewing it as a personal assault.” This subversion of an idea so ingrained in our national psyche provoked some questions in me, as a student writing publically online, who is also a citizen. Having rarely considered the privileges of expressing my active citizenship, I began to wonder what I, and other citizens, surrender when we do not engage in such activities as public writing, speaking, and advocacy. I was reminded of a passage from Louisa Hall’s book, *Speak*, in which she writes: 

> > “When no one talks to you for a long time, and you don’t talk to anyone else, you start to feel as if you’re attached by a very thin string. Like a little balloon, floating just over everyone’s heads. I don’t feel connected to anything. I’m on the brink of disappearing completely.” (21)

To speak is to be alive, to participate, and to be seen. But what are the implications of such an ontology when speaking out is a threat to your life, and even your existence is politicized? For Perez’s students, to speak is to threaten, to provoke, and to demand more than what’s been allotted. How can we shift this paradigm? What has to change in order for people who are undocumented to be able to speak and be seen without being persecuted? First, we must create an easier path to citizenship, especially for those who have been living here for practically their whole lives. Most importantly, we must change the dominant culture that allows for certain Americans to believe that they have the right to be gatekeepers of American citizenship.
