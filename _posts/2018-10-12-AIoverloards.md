## OUR AI OVERLORDS

Themes about the ethics and capabilities of artificial intelligence are abundantly explored in Louisa Hall’s novel *Speak*. The different voices that comprise the narrative of the novel often leave us asking questions about the line between humanity and technology, the realities of a future where AI is commonplace, and the implications of artificial memory on relationships and the soul. At one point during the Memoirs of Stephen R. Chinn: Chapter 3, Stephen Chinn, creator of the banned “babybots” of the story, writes: 

>> “And what if they took over? What if they relieved us of power? We tend to assume that sentient machines would be inevitably demonic. But what if they were responsible leaders? Could they do much worse than we’ve done? They would immediately institute a system of laws. The constitution would be algorithmic. They would govern the world according to the functions and the axioms their programmers gave them.” (86)

These musings resonated with me, as I believe that the questions raised here will become increasingly relevant as we propel ever-forward towards such a future. Okay, so what if robots do take over? Case one, as touched on above, is that they are demonic, and following the model established by *The Matrix*, they take over the world and exploit humankind. We non-programmers tend to err on the side of machines being inherently evil, as has become ingrained in us through many a Sci Fi trope (often our only touchstones for imaginings of AI). But programmer Stephen Chinn offers an alternative; Case two: The robots take over as responsible leaders. There are several implications of such a future, which I will explore through the limited perspective of a citizen who enjoys American democracy. The bedrock of our nation and our political system is the Constitution, the interpretation of which is often a subject of debate. Our code of law and our judicial system are also some of the cornerstones of our government. But how would these institutions be altered in a nation ruled by machines? What happens when these documents and rules become “algorithmic?” Would legal injustice disappear? Would political debate become redundant? What would happen in cases like those of Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey Ford, whose stories were heard by a board of white, male Senators? I think one of the most important aspects of our laws and our Constitution is that they are living, breathing things; they change over time to reflect our progress. Would this be lost in a government by machines? And would these machines, governing by the code written by their programmers, simply serve as a proxy for those programmers? How would this change who has access to power? Would this derail our electoral system? I fear these hypothetical questions, serious as they are, are unanswerable at this time. But they must be considered before we are launched fully and entirely into the new era of AI.
