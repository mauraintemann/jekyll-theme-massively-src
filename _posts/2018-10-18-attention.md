excerpt: "Love in the Attention Economy"

“Attention, at least the kind we care about, is an intrinsically scarce resource,” according to Michael Goldhaber in his 1997 piece, *The Attention Economy: the Natural Economy of the Net.* This is the cornerstone of the Internet’s attention economy, where information is abundant, and therefore the capital that pushes the system is the information’s ability to demand attention. This reality has become evermore salient in 2018 than it had been in 1997, when the Internet was very, *very* different. Now, our browsing, shopping, and even our news has been rewired by the attention economy, with companies and media outlets often sacrificing truth and authenticity for a grabby title. It’s interesting that something so personal as attention has become so readily exploitable by businesses and corporations. I’m reminded of a scene from one of my favorite movies, Greta Gerwig’s *Lady Bird*. In it, high school senior Christine (aka Lady Bird) is talking to her Catholic school advisor about her college essay, in which she writes about her home town of Sacramento, a place she’s sworn to move far away from.   

*Sister Sarah Joan: You clearly love Sacramento.*
  
*Lady Bird: I do?*

*Sister Sarah Joan: You write about Sacramento so affectionately and with such care.*

*Lady Bird: I was just describing it.*

*Sister Sarah Joan: Well it comes across as love.*

*Lady Bird: Sure, I guess I pay attention.*

*Sister Sarah Joan: Don't you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention?*


This moment has always jarred me. Sister Sarah Joan’s open ended question brings to mind the tenuous relationship between Lady Bird and her mother. Throughout the movie, Lady Bird fights her mother every chance she can get, chaffing against her strict, cold dominion. In this moment, we see Lady Bird realize that perhaps her mother’s controlling nature is an expression of love rather than hatred. What does link between love and attention mean for the attention economy? In one way, it implies something a bit radical -- that websites and companies on the Internet seek our love as capital within this economy. To some extent, this could be true; companies want you to fall in love with their product, websites want you to love browsing enough to bear an onslaught of advertisements. You could even argue that clickbait designed to make us *angry* seeks our love, as it is human nature to love having something to be furious about. Another, more cynical implication of this equating of love and attention is that our doling out of love within our own lives, in the real world, exists in an economy. If attention is scarce, then love is, too. We like to think of love as boundless, unabiding. But in this formation, love is limited, interchangeable, commodifiable. We give love to our family, our friends, our hobbies, our homes, our treasures. I think it’s realistic to imagine this love functioning within an economy; after all, when we love someone or something, whether we know it or not, we often seek something in return.
